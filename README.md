# pyWebCrawler
A Python POC project to crawl websites, list internal and external links on each site and establish site mapping of sorts

# Steps

* Create database called webmap and create tables. Use webmap.sql to create database structure.
* Update mysql_config.py with MySQL credentials
* Run seed.py either as-is or add a URL from the command line, e.g. 

  *python seed.py https://github.com*

Once you have enough entries in your *sites* table, run 

  *python link_collect.py* 

This will crawl all sites in *sites* table that have not yet been scanned and create an an association between *id_site1* (site where the external links were found) and *id_site2* (each external site ID)
